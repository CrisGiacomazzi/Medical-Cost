# Medical-Cost Risk

## Business Understanding
One of the key financial challenges for healthcare insurance providers is managing the costs associated with prolonged hospital stays (Length of Stay – LOS). Extended hospitalizations often involve high expenditures related to medications, diagnostic exams, specialist consultations, and an increased risk of hospital-acquired infections. These factors collectively raise the insurer’s cost burden and may negatively impact the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.

To control expenses, insurance companies may **deny coverage for specific drugs or diagnostic procedures**. While this can reduce immediate costs, it **risks diminishing patient satisfaction** and **compromising care quality**, especially if denials affect critical aspects of treatment.

Clinical literature highlights that certain patient profiles are more likely to experience longer hospital stays, including elderly individuals and those with multiple comorbidities (three or more). **These high-risk groups require closer attention and proactive care planning.**

The objective of this project was to **identify patients with a higher risk of prolonged hospital stay**s, using historical data to detect trends and risk factors. A descriptive dashboard was developed to:

* Monitor hospital LOS patterns,
* Alert stakeholders to emerging issues,
* Support decision-making by suggesting targeted interventions.

This dashboard serves as a tool to **improve resource allocation**, **enhance patient care pathways**, and ultimately **reduce unnecessary hospital costs**, aligning clinical outcomes with **financial sustainability**.
